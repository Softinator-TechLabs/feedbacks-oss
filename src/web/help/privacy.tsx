      <h1>Privacy & data use</h1>
      <p>
        Feedbacks is a private team review service. Access to projects, discussion and
        screenshots is restricted to authorized members and scoped tokens.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Information stored</h2>
        <p>
          The service stores account identity, project memberships, comments and replies,
          reviewer policy, timestamps, target URLs, viewport and element context, and
          screenshots that users explicitly approve for upload. Sensitive query keys and
          URL fragments are removed server-side. Avoid confidential data in comments, URL
          paths and element identifiers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Passwords are hashed. Web sessions use HttpOnly cookies. The extension stores
          its paired device credential in trusted extension storage and sends it only to
          the selected Feedbacks service.
        </p>
        <p>
          A guest feedback link lets someone submit a name, page URL and comment to one
          project after a Turnstile check. The link does not reveal existing feedback or
          private member information. The project team can see submitted guest feedback.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Capture is explicit</h2>
        <p>
          The extension captures only when you initiate review. It does not continuously
          record your screen. Screenshots include the visible page, including forms and
          embedded frames, without automatic masking. Nothing is uploaded until you send
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Optional instant right-click installs a local listener on HTTP(S) websites after
          you approve Chrome’s all-website permission. It does not upload browsing history
          or capture pages in the background. General projects accept any website;
          ordinary projects keep their approved origins and all projects still require
          membership.
        </p>
        <p>
          Approved images are validated, stripped of image metadata and stored privately.
          Project authorization is checked when an image is read. No public bucket links
          are provided.
        </p>

        <h2>Optional diagnostics</h2>
        <p>
          Console and resource timing collection starts only when you choose it in the
          extension. It ends on capture, navigation, stop or after five minutes, with at
          most 25 console and 50 resource entries. Review the entries and explicitly
          enable sharing in the editor before sending them with a thread.
        </p>
        <p>
          URL credentials, queries and fragments are stripped. Headers, request bodies,
          cookies and storage values are not collected. Redaction is best effort; review
          messages and URL paths for private information. Shared entries follow the same
          project access and retention rules as discussion. Page-generated diagnostics are
          untrusted and may be incomplete.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Access, retention and removal</h2>
        <p>
          Owners manage access. You can revoke agent tokens and paired extensions in
          Account. Archiving keeps discussion and evidence; it is not erasure. Contact
          your deployment owner for exact retention, backup handling, account requests and
          operator-managed deletion.
        </p>
        <p>
          This application does not sell feedback, include advertising trackers, or send
          it to a model provider automatically. An authorized developer may share project
          context with a separately configured agent; that client’s own privacy settings
          also apply.
